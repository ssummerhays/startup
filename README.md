### Elevator Pitch

Have you ever wanted to play golf with a big group and all track all of the scores and compete together in different formats? The Golf Leaderboard application provides a place for individuals to group together and compete against one another. One user can create a tournament, choosing the groupâ€™s desired format. Each golfer can then login to the application, join the tournament, and submit their scores hole by hole, allowing each player to see where they stack up against their competition.
