# Golf Leaderboard Application

## Specification Deliverable

### Elevator Pitch

Have you ever wanted to play golf with a big group and all track all of the scores and compete together in different formats? The Golf Leaderboard application provides a place for individuals to group together and compete against one another. One user can create a tournament, choosing the groupâ€™s desired format. Each golfer can then login to the application, join the tournament, and submit their scores hole by hole, allowing each player to see where they stack up against their competition.

### Key Features

* Secure login over HTTPS
* Ability to create a new tournament in different formats such as standard strokeplay, skins game, or stableford
* Ability for users to enter their scores hole by hole
* Scores are displayed on the leaderboard page in order from best to worst
* Weather forecast available on leaderboard page

### Technologies
I will use the required technologies in the following ways.
* **HTML** - Uses correct HTML structure for application. Three HTML pages. One for login, one for the main leaderboard page, and one for entering scores.
*  **CSS** - Application styling that looks good on different screen sizes, uses good whitespace, color choice and contrast.
*  **React** - Provides login, leaderboard display, display of leaders in under-par scores, and use of React for routing and components.
*  **Service** - Backend service with endpoints for:
    - login
    - submitting scores
    - retrieving weather information
    - retrieving leaderboard status
* **DB/Login** - Store users, scores, and tournament results in database. Register and login users. Credentials securely stored in database. Can't join tournaments and enter scores unless authenticated.
*  **Websocket** - As each user enters a score, their score and current hole are broadcast to all other users.
